The following formats are considered Code Blocks:
  - Wrapped with ```
  - Supports configurations: language, title, icon, where title and icon are optional
  - content can be code, command line examples, text or any other content

<code_block_sample>
```{language} [{title}] [icon={icon}]
{content}
```
</code_block_sample>

Code Block Translation: 
- For D2 code blocks, only translate labels
- For other language code blocks, **only translate comments starting with #, keep all other content unchanged without translation**
