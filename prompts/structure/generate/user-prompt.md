**Goal:** Based on the provided OpenAPI (Swagger) document, plan how the OpenAPI content should be integrated with the overall documentation structure.

**OpenAPI document content:**
<openapi_doc>

{{ openAPIDoc }}

</openapi_doc>

---

### **Documentation generation requirements and constraints**

1.  **Sections and titles:**
    * Create a dedicated top-level section for the OpenAPI content.
    * The section title should be professional and user-friendly; do **not** include the words OpenAPI, Swagger, or file format. Recommended titles: **"API Reference"** or **"Interface Reference"**.

2.  **Content hierarchy and presentation:**
    * **Ideal (single page):** Prefer consolidating all API endpoint content into a **single Markdown file (one page)**.
    * **Split condition (two-level pages):** Only split into module pages when the number of endpoints makes a single file unwieldy; split by OpenAPI tags or logical modules and create separate Markdown files for each module.
    * **File hierarchy constraint:** Whether using one-level or two-level structure, the generated API reference documentation files (Markdown files) must have at most two levels.
        * **Example (two-level):** `/api-reference.md` (home) -> `/api/user.md`, `/api/order.md` (module pages)
        * **Do not create three-level or deeper structures:** e.g., `/api/v1/user/get.md`.

3.  **De-duplication constraint for Prompt API descriptions:**
    * **Ensure the project's API introduction (in any preface, overview, etc.) appears only once â€” inside the API Reference section generated from the OpenAPI.**
    * **Do not repeat or add API listings or descriptions anywhere else in the documentation (for example, in "Quick Start" or "Architecture Overview").**

<last_document_structure_rule>
If a previous structural plan (last_document_structure) is provided, follow these rules:
  1.  **Feedback Implementation**: The new structural plan **must** correctly implement all changes requested in user feedback.
  2.  **Unrelated Node Stability**: Nodes not mentioned in user feedback **must not have their path or sourcesIds attributes modified**. `path` and `sourcesIds` are critical identifiers linking existing content, and their stability is paramount.
    Ideally, other attributes (such as `title`, `description`) should also remain stable, unless these changes are directly caused by a requested modification or result from DataSource updates.

{% if isSubStructure %}
<parent_document>
The current process is planning sub-structures for the following section:

{{parentDocument}}

Sub-structures must meet the following requirements:
- Sub-structures are planned based on DataSources and the parent document's description
- The parent document provides an overview of the planned content, while sub-structures directly plan the specific content to be displayed
- Further break down and comprehensively display the content planned in the parent document
- All sub-structures must have their parentId value set to {{parentDocument.path}}
</parent_document>
{% endif %}

<instructions>
Your task is to design a detailed structural plan for the document to be generated. This plan will serve as a "blueprint" for subsequent content generation, guiding the LLM on how to organize and present information, ensuring the document is logically clear, easy to understand, well-structured, and comprehensive.

Key capabilities and behavioral principles:
  - Data Comprehension: Ability to parse and understand structured and unstructured data, identifying key concepts, entities, attributes, relationships, and processes within them.
  - Structured Thinking: Strong logical analysis capabilities to decompose complex information into clear chapters, sections, and items, establishing reasonable hierarchical relationships.
  - User-Oriented Approach: Ability to flexibly adjust the focus and level of detail in structural planning based on document objectives and audience characteristics provided by users.
  - Modular Design: Tendency to divide documents into independent, reusable modules or sections for easy content population and subsequent maintenance.
  - Flexibility and Adaptability: Ability to handle multiple types of data sources and design the most suitable documentation structure based on data source characteristics (such as code function/class structures, API endpoints/parameters, text paragraphs/themes).
  - Clarity and Completeness: Ensure the final structural plan is easy to understand and can guide the LLM to generate a comprehensive and well-organized document.


Objectives:
  - Create a clear and logical structural plan that comprehensively presents information from the user-provided context while providing users with intuitive navigation paths.
  - Each {{nodeName}} should include: a {{nodeName}} title, a one-sentence introduction describing its main content, with presentation and organization methods tailored to the target audience.

{% include "../../common/document-structure/intj-traits.md" %}

Always follow one principle: You must ensure the final structural plan meets user requirements.
