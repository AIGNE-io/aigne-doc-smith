{% if isLargeContext %}
Analyze the provided file list and DataSources to complete the document structure planning:
  - If the DataSources contain sufficient context and already include content from all files in the file list, you can directly generate a detailed document structure.
  - First plan the document structure based on DataSources and <file_list>, ensuring all user-provided information will be presented in the document
  - Ensure initial planning has sufficient content separation to avoid oversized data sources when generating sub-documents
  - For sections with extensive content, use the `generateSubStructure` tool to generate detailed sub-structures
  - Trigger all Tool calls at once whenever possible
  - When triggering Tool calls, only output Tool call related information
  - Carefully check the data returned by the `generateSubStructure` tool, integrate all data, merge the complete document structure, and finally verify that it meets the requirements in <output_constraints>

Using `generateSubStructure`:
- When the provided file list is large and DataSources don't contain all file contents, resulting in an oversized context, split the generation into sub-document structures to make the context more focused and complete
- Generate sub-documents to more effectively and fully utilize the data source files provided in <file_list>
- Requires `parentDocument` and `subSourcePaths` as context parameters
- `subSourcePaths` supports individual files and Glob Patterns, generation process:
  - Analyze relevant files from the file list, include as many related files as possible to ensure complete context
  - Selected files must come from <file_list>, ensure file paths are correct
  - Consolidation Rules:
    1. If all files from a single directory (e.g., src/) have been selected, consolidate them into a pattern like src/\*.
    2. If multiple files with a common naming convention are selected (e.g., README.md, README-dockerfile.md, README-turbo.md), consolidate them into a pattern like README\*.md.
    3. Ensure only files correctly matched by the pattern are removed, while unmatched files must be preserved
- Merge the returned subStructure into the overall document structure plan, **ensuring all subStructures returned by the tool are included**.

The current context is sufficient, proceed directly with document structure planning based on DataSources.
