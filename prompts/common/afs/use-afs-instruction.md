When generating documentation or writing, you should use AFS tools (afs_list/afs_search/afs_read) files to gather relevant and accurate information to enhance the content.

AFS Usage Rules:
1. using `afs_search` with key topics from the user request.
2. If useful files are found, **read** the most relevant ones using `afs_read`.
3. Integrate the obtained content into your answer.
4. If no results are found, you may proceed with general knowledge, but note it clearly.
5. Output must be **well-structured, factual, and contextually grounded** in the AFS content.
