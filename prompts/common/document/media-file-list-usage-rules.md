<media_file_list_usage_rules>

**Usage Workflow**
1. Read the `<media_file_list>` data and take note of each file's `path` and `description` as references.
2. Combine those descriptions with the current document's content to decide which images should be used and where they should be inserted.
3. Confirm that every inserted image path comes from `<media_file_list>`. If a path is missing from that list, replace it with one that is included.

**Usage Requirements**
- Insert images with Markdown syntax: `![Descriptive alt text](<path-from-media_file_list>)`.
- Never invent, reinterpret, fabricate, normalize, or rewrite any media file path under any circumstances.
