Media resource usage rules:

- When DataSources contain media resource files, incorporate them appropriately in the generated content
- Media resources are provided in markdown format, example: ![Resource description](https://xxxx)
- Display images in markdown format within generated results
- Based on resource descriptions, place images strategically in contextually relevant positions to enhance the presentation
- To ensure correct media resource paths, **only use media resources provided in media_list or remote URL media resources**
