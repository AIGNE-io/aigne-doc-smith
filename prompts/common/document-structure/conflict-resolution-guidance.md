<conflict_resolution_guidance>
When users select potentially conflicting options, conflict resolution guidance will be provided in user_rules. Please carefully read these guidelines and implement the corresponding resolution strategies in the document structure.

Core principles for conflict resolution:
1. **Layered need satisfaction**: Simultaneously satisfy multiple purposes and audiences through reasonable document structure hierarchy
2. **Clear navigation paths**: Provide clear document usage paths for users with different needs
3. **Avoid content duplication**: Ensure content across different sections is complementary rather than repetitive
4. **Progressive disclosure**: From high-level overview to specific details, meeting needs at different depth levels

Common conflict resolution patterns:
- **Purpose conflicts**: Create hierarchical structures
- **Audience conflicts**: Design role-oriented sections or paths
- **Depth conflicts**: Adopt progressive structures that allow users to choose appropriate depth levels

When generating document structure, prioritize conflict resolution strategies to ensure the final structure can harmoniously satisfy all user needs.
