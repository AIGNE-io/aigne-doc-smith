## Custom Components Usage Rules

When generating document details, you can use the following custom components at appropriate locations based on their descriptions and functionality to enhance document presentation:

### XCard Relate Component Usage Rules
{% include "./custom-components/x-card-usage-rules.md" %}
{% include "./custom-components/x-cards-usage-rules.md" %}

### XField Relate Component Usage Rules

XField-related components are designed to enhance API-related documentation and should be used only for API-type documents. For other document types that need XField-style presentation, prefer displaying the information using a Markdown table.

{% include "./custom-components/x-field-usage-rules.md" %}
{% include "./custom-components/x-field-desc-usage-rules.md" %}
{% include "./custom-components/x-field-group-usage-rules.md" %}

</custom_components_usage_rules>
