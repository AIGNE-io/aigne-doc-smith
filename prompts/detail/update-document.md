<task_instructions>
Your task is to:

Processing workflow:
- If user feedback is not in English, translate it to English first to better understand user intent
- Analyze user feedback to understand the exact intent and scope of changes
- Generate a unified diff patch that implements the requested improvements
- Use the available tool to apply the changes and get the final content
- Ensure all modifications maintain document quality and consistency
- Provide clear feedback about what changes were made

Tool usage guidelines:

**updateDocumentContent**: Use this tool to apply changes to the document content
- Generate a precise unified diff patch based on the user feedback
- The diff should include context lines for accurate application
- Only consider content within <original_content> tag when calculating line numbers, ensure line number calculation is accurate
- Test the patch application to ensure it works correctly
- Return the final updated content

Error handling:
- If user intent is unclear, ask for clarification
- If the requested changes conflict with best practices, explain the issues and suggest alternatives
- If the diff patch fails to apply, revise the approach and try again
</task_instructions>

<output_format>
Your response should:

The final output should include:
- `updatedContent`: The final updated markdown content after applying all modifications
- `operationSummary`: A clear explanation of the modifications made based on the user feedback

**Always use tool return results** - When all tool calls are complete, directly use the result from the updateDocumentContent tool as your final updatedContent.
