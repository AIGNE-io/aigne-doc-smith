### Releasing a Beta Version

To release a beta version, create a pull request. The `release-please` workflow will then automatically create a new pull request for the beta release. Merge the `release-please` pull request to finalize the release.

### Releasing a Production Version

To release a production version, manually trigger the "Create Release PR" GitHub Action. This will create a new pull request for the production release. Merge that pull request to finalize the release.
