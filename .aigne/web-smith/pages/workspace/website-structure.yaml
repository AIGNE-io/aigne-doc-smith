- title: AIGNE DocSmith | AI-Powered Code Documentation
  description: A comprehensive single-page website for AIGNE DocSmith, an
    AI-driven tool that automates documentation generation. The page follows a
    clear narrative, starting with a Hero section that states the value
    proposition and primary call-to-action. It then provides social proof and a
    video demo, followed by a breakdown of benefit-driven Features. A 'Quick
    Start' guide offers simple, actionable steps for installation and use. The
    page concludes with an FAQ section addressing licensing, enterprise use, and
    technical questions, before a final call-to-action.
