  faqList:
  - question: "Is my source code secure with AIGNE DocSmith?"
    answer: "Absolutely. When using the AIGNE Hub, your code is processed securely
      and is never stored or used for training. For maximum security, our enterprise
      plan allows you to deploy DocSmith on your own private infrastructure, ensuring
      your code never leaves your environment."
  - question: "What programming languages and frameworks do you support?"
    answer: "DocSmith is designed to be language-agnostic. It intelligently analyzes
      your project structure and works with most modern languages and frameworks
      right out of the box, including JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java,
      and more."
  - question: "Do I need to provide my own API keys for the AI models?"
    answer: "Nope! By default, DocSmith uses the AIGNE Hub, which requires zero
      API keys and gives you access to top models like GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
      However, you can easily configure your own keys if you prefer direct access
      to providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google."
  - question: "How does DocSmith keep the documentation updated?"
    answer: "DocSmith's smart update feature automatically detects changes in your
      codebase. When you run the `update` command, it identifies which parts of
      the documentation are affected and intelligently regenerates only those sections,
      saving you time and effort."
  - question: "Can I customize the style and structure of the output?"
    answer: "Yes! You have full control. During the initial setup, you can choose
      from different documentation styles (e.g., Technical, User-Friendly) and
      target audiences. You can also customize the source paths and output structure
      to perfectly match your project's needs."
