    faqTitle: "Power-User Tips & Tricks"
    faqList:
      - question: "How do I force a complete regeneration of all documents?"
        answer: "Easy! Just use the `--forceRegenerate` flag with the generate command: `aigne doc generate --forceRegenerate`. This tells DocSmith to ignore the cache and rebuild everything from the ground up."
      - question: "Can I provide feedback to the AI during generation?"
        answer: "Absolutely! The `--feedback` flag is your best friend. For example: `aigne doc generate --feedback \"Add more API examples\"`. The AI will use your input to refine the content."
      - question: "How do I translate only specific documents?"
        answer: "You can target specific files using the `--docs` flag. Combine it with `--langs` to get exactly what you need: `aigne doc translate --langs ja --docs overview.md`."
      - question: "What if I want to publish to my own server?"
        answer: "No problem! Use the `--appUrl` flag to point to your custom Discuss Kit instance: `aigne doc publish --appUrl https://your-docs.com`."
      - question: "How can I ensure consistent terminology in translations?"
        answer: "Use a custom glossary! The `--glossary` flag lets you provide a markdown file with key terms to ensure they are translated consistently across all languages: `aigne doc translate --glossary @path/to/glossary.md`."
