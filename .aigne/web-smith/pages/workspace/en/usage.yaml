    faqTitle: "Frequently Asked Questions"
    faqList:
      - question: "Do I need API keys to use these commands?"
        answer: "Nope! By default, DocSmith uses the AIGNE Hub, which requires
          no API keys and lets you switch between models like Gemini and GPT on
          the fly. You can add your own keys for direct provider access if you
          prefer."
      - question: "How do I generate docs for only a specific folder?"
        answer: "During the `aigne doc init` setup, you can specify exactly which
          source paths to include or exclude. You can also edit the configuration
          file directly for more granular control."
      - question: "What's the difference between `generate` and `update`?"
        answer: "`generate` is for creating the entire documentation set from
          scratch, perfect for the first run. `update` is for making targeted
          changes to existing documents based on code changes or new feedback,
          which is much faster."
      - question: "Can I customize the translation glossary?"
        answer: "Absolutely! Use the `--glossary` flag with the `translate` command
          to pass a custom glossary file. This ensures your key terminology stays
          consistent across all languages."
