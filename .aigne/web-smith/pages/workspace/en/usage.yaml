      - question: "Can I force a complete regeneration of all documents?"
        answer: "Absolutely! Just use the `--forceRegenerate` flag with the generate command, like this: `aigne doc generate --forceRegenerate`. This is perfect for when you want a completely fresh start."
      - question: "How do I provide feedback to improve a specific document?"
        answer: "It's easy! Use the `--feedback` flag with the `generate` or `update` commands. For example: `aigne doc update --docs overview.md --feedback \"Add a section on advanced usage\"`."
      - question: "Can I use my own API keys for services like OpenAI or Claude?"
        answer: "Yes, you can! While DocSmith uses the AIGNE Hub by default (no keys needed), you can easily configure your own API keys for direct access to providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google."
      - question: "What if I only want to translate specific documents?"
        answer: "No problem! The `translate` command lets you target specific files. Just use the `--docs` flag, like this: `aigne doc translate --langs ja --docs examples.md`."
