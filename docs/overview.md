# Overview

AIGNE DocSmith is an AI-driven tool that generates documentation directly from your source code. Built on the [AIGNE Framework](https://www.aigne.io/en/framework), it automates the creation of structured, multi-language documents. This process reduces the manual effort of writing and maintaining documentation, ensuring it stays synchronized with the codebase.

## Part of the AIGNE Ecosystem

DocSmith is a key component of the [AIGNE](https://www.aigne.io) ecosystem, a platform for developing AI applications. It integrates with other AIGNE components to use the platform's AI capabilities and infrastructure.

The following diagram illustrates how DocSmith fits within the AIGNE architecture:

## Core Features

DocSmith provides a set of features to automate and simplify the documentation process:

*   **Structure Planning:** Analyzes a codebase to generate a logical document structure.
*   **Content Generation:** Populates the planned document structure with content generated from the source code.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Translates documentation into 12 languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish.
*   **AIGNE Hub Integration:** Uses [AIGNE Hub](https://www.aigne.io/en/hub) as an LLM provider, allowing model switching without managing individual API keys.
*   **Document Publishing:** Publishes documentation to the official platform at [docsmith.aigne.io](https://docsmith.aigne.io/app/) or to a user's own [Discuss Kit](https://www.arcblock.io/docs/web3-kit/en/discuss-kit) instance.
*   **Iterative Updates:** Detects source code changes to update documentation and supports targeted regeneration of specific documents based on user feedback.
