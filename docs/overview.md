# Overview

AIGNE DocSmith is an AI-driven tool that generates documentation directly from your source code. Built on the [AIGNE Framework](https://www.aigne.io/en/framework), it automates the creation of structured, multi-language documents. This process reduces the manual effort of writing and maintaining documentation, allowing developers to focus on building features while ensuring documentation stays synchronized with the codebase.

## Part of the AIGNE Ecosystem

DocSmith is a key component of the [AIGNE](https://www.aigne.io) ecosystem, a platform for developing AI applications. It integrates with other AIGNE components to use the platform's AI capabilities and infrastructure.

The following diagram illustrates how DocSmith fits within the AIGNE architecture:

## Core Features

DocSmith provides a set of features designed to automate and simplify the documentation process:

*   **Automated Structure Planning:** Analyzes your codebase to propose a logical document structure. This saves developers the initial effort of outlining the documentation from scratch.

*   **AI-Powered Content Generation:** Populates the document structure with detailed content by interpreting your source code, providing a complete first draft to accelerate the writing process.

*   **Multi-Language Support:** Translates documentation into 12 languages, including English, Chinese, and Japanese, helping developers reach a global audience with minimal effort.

*   **AIGNE Hub Integration:** Connects to [AIGNE Hub](https://www.aigne.io/en/hub), a service that acts as a central provider for various Large Language Models (LLMs). This allows you to switch between models from providers like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic without managing individual API keys, which simplifies configuration.

*   **Document Publishing:** Publishes generated documentation to the official platform at [docsmith.aigne.io](https://docsmith.aigne.io/app/) or your own [Discuss Kit](https://www.arcblock.io/docs/web3-kit/en/discuss-kit) instance. This gives you flexible options for previewing and distributing your documentation.

*   **Iterative Updates:** Detects source code changes to update documentation and allows for targeted regeneration based on specific feedback. This helps keep docs consistently in sync with the code.
