# Managing Preferences

AIGNE DocSmith is designed to learn from your feedback. When you refine or correct generated content, DocSmith can convert that feedback into persistent rules, called preferences. These rules ensure that your specific style, structural requirements, and content policies are applied consistently in future documentation tasks. All preferences are stored in a human-readable YAML file located at `.aigne/doc-smith/preferences.yml` in your project root.

## The Preference Lifecycle

The following diagram illustrates how your feedback becomes a reusable rule that can be applied to future tasks and managed via the command line.

### How DocSmith Learns from Feedback

When you provide feedback during the `refine` or `translate` stages, an internal agent called the 'Feedback Refiner' analyzes your input. Its goal is to distinguish between a one-time fix (e.g., correcting a typo) and a reusable policy (e.g., "always write code comments in English"). If it determines the feedback represents a lasting instruction, it creates a new preference rule.

Each rule has several key properties that define its behavior:

| Property | Description |
|---|---|
| **id** | A unique identifier for the rule (e.g., `pref_a1b2c3d4`). |
| **active** | A boolean (`true`/`false`) indicating if the rule is currently enabled. |
| **scope** | Defines when the rule should be applied: `global`, `structure`, `document`, or `translation`. |
| **rule** | The instruction that will be passed to the AI in future tasks. |
| **feedback** | The original natural language feedback you provided. |
| **createdAt** | The ISO 8601 timestamp of when the rule was created. |
| **paths** | An optional list of file paths. If present, the rule only applies to content generated for those specific paths. |

## Managing Preferences via the CLI

You can view and manage all your saved preferences using the `aigne doc prefs` command. This allows you to list, activate, deactivate, or permanently remove rules.

### Listing All Preferences

To see all saved preferences, both active and inactive, use the `--list` flag.

```bash List all preferences icon=lucide:terminal
aigne doc prefs --list
```

The command displays a formatted list explaining the status, scope, ID, and any path limitations for each rule.

**Example Output:**

```text Example Output icon=lucide:clipboard-list
# User Preferences

**Format explanation:**
- ðŸŸ¢ = Active preference, âšª = Inactive preference
- [scope] = Preference scope (global, structure, document, translation)
- ID = Unique preference identifier
- Paths = Specific file paths (if applicable)

ðŸŸ¢ [structure] pref_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8 | Paths: overview.md
   Add a 'Next Steps' section at the end of overview documents.
 
âšª [document] pref_i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
   Code comments must be written in English.
 
```

### Toggling Preference Status

If you want to temporarily disable a rule without deleting it, you can toggle its active status. Use the `--toggle` flag.

Running the command without an ID will launch an interactive mode, allowing you to select one or more preferences to toggle:

```bash Toggle preferences interactively icon=lucide:terminal
aigne doc prefs --toggle
```

To toggle specific rules directly, provide their IDs using the `--id` flag:

```bash Toggle a specific preference icon=lucide:terminal
aigne doc prefs --toggle --id pref_i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

### Removing Preferences

To permanently delete one or more preferences, use the `--remove` flag. This action cannot be undone.

For an interactive selection prompt, run the command without an ID:

```bash Remove preferences interactively icon=lucide:terminal
aigne doc prefs --remove
```

To remove specific rules directly by their ID, use the `--id` flag:

```bash Remove a specific preference icon=lucide:terminal
aigne doc prefs --remove --id pref_a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8
```
