# Core Features

AIGNE DocSmith provides a complete toolkit to manage your documentation lifecycle, from initial creation directly from your source code to publishing and translation. This section provides an overview of the main commands and capabilities you'll use to create and maintain high-quality documentation.

Each feature is designed to be straightforward, often requiring just a single command to perform complex tasks.

## Generate Documentation from Your Code

The primary function of DocSmith is to automatically create a full set of documentation by analyzing your source code. The `aigne doc generate` command intelligently plans a logical structure and then writes detailed content for each section, giving you a comprehensive starting point in minutes.

For a complete guide on creating your first set of documents, see **[Generate Documentation](./features-generate-documentation.md)**.

## Update and Refine Intelligently

As your code evolves, your documentation can easily keep pace. DocSmith automatically detects source code changes and updates only the necessary documents. You can also use the `aigne doc update` command to regenerate specific documents with targeted feedback, ensuring your content is always accurate and relevant.

## Translate Documentation for a Global Audience

Reach a wider audience by translating your documentation into over 12 languages, including Chinese, Spanish, German, and Japanese. The `aigne doc translate` command provides an interactive way to select which documents to translate and which languages to target.

## Publish Your Docs Online

Once your documentation is ready, you can easily publish it for others to see. The `aigne doc publish` command allows you to deploy your docs to the official DocSmith platform or to your own self-hosted Discuss Kit instance, making them accessible to your team or the public.
