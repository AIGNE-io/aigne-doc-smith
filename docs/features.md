# Core Features

AIGNE DocSmith streamlines the entire documentation workflow through a set of intuitive commands. From initial creation based on your source code to ongoing updates and final publication, these core features provide a comprehensive solution for managing your project's documentation.

This section provides an overview of the main capabilities. For detailed instructions, please refer to the specific sub-sections.

### Generate Documentation

Create a complete, well-structured set of documents from your source code with a single command. DocSmith analyzes your project and builds the documentation from the ground up. If it's your first time, an interactive wizard will guide you through the setup process automatically.

For a detailed guide on creating your first set of documents, see the [Generate Documentation](./features-generate-documentation.md) section.

### Update and Refine

Keep your documentation synchronized with your codebase. DocSmith can automatically detect changes and update only the necessary files. You can also target specific documents for regeneration with feedback to refine the content, either through command-line flags or an interactive menu.

Explore how to keep your content current in the [Update and Refine](./features-update-and-refine.md) guide.

### Publish Your Docs

When your documentation is ready, you can publish it to make it accessible. Choose to publish to the official DocSmith platform or to your own self-hosted Discuss Kit instance through a simple interactive menu.
