# Initial Setup

This document provides a step-by-step guide to the interactive setup process for AIGNE DocSmith. This procedure is initiated automatically the first time you run the `aigne doc generate` command, or it can be started manually. The objective is to create a `config.yaml` file that stores your preferences for generating documentation.

## How to Start the Setup Process

To begin the configuration manually, navigate to your project's root directory in a terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
aigne doc init
```

This command launches an interactive questionnaire to configure your documentation settings. The process consists of 10 steps designed to tailor the generated documentation to your specific requirements.

## Configuration Steps

The setup process will prompt you with a series of questions. The following sections detail each step.

### Step 1: Define Documentation Purpose

The first step is to define the primary goals of your documentation. This selection influences the tone, structure, and focus of the generated content.

**Prompt:** `üìù [1/10]: What should your documentation help readers achieve?`

You can select one or more options from the following list:

| Option | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `getStarted` | Get started quickly | Help new users go from zero to working in <30 minutes. |
| `completeTasks` | Complete specific tasks | Guide users through common workflows and use cases. |
| `findAnswers` | Find answers fast | Provide a searchable reference for all features and APIs. |
| `understandSystem` | Understand the system | Explain how it works and the reasoning behind design decisions. |
| `solveProblems` | Solve problems | Help users troubleshoot and fix issues. |
| `mixedPurpose` | Mix of above | Cover multiple needs. |

### Step 2: Identify Target Audience

Next, specify the primary readers of your documentation. This helps to adjust the language and technical depth appropriately.

**Prompt:** `üë• [2/10]: Who will be reading your documentation?`

You may select multiple audiences from this list:

| Option | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `endUsers` | End users (non-technical) | People who use the product but do not code. |
| `developers` | Developers integrating | Engineers adding this to their projects. |
| `devops` | DevOps/Infrastructure | Teams deploying, monitoring, and maintaining systems. |
| `decisionMakers` | Technical decision makers | Architects or leads evaluating the technology. |
| `supportTeams` | Support teams | People helping others use the product. |
| `mixedTechnical` | Mixed technical audience | A combination of developers, DevOps, and other technical users. |

### Step 3: Specify Reader Knowledge Level

Indicate the assumed knowledge level of your audience. This ensures the content is presented at an appropriate level, avoiding information that is either too basic or too complex.

**Prompt:** `üß† [3/10]: How much do readers already know about your project?`

Select the option that best describes your readers:

| Option | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `completeBeginners` | Complete beginners | New to the domain or technology entirely. |
| `domainFamiliar` | Domain-familiar, tool-new | Know the problem space but are new to this specific solution. |
| `experiencedUsers` | Experienced users | Regular users who need reference material or advanced topics. |
| `emergencyTroubleshooting` | Emergency/troubleshooting | Users who need to fix a problem quickly. |
| `exploringEvaluating` | Exploring/evaluating | Users trying to determine if the tool fits their needs. |

### Step 4: Set Documentation Depth

Choose how detailed the documentation should be. This parameter determines the scope and level of detail in the generated content.

**Prompt:** `üìä [4/10]: How detailed should your documentation be?`

Select one of the following levels:

| Option | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `essentialOnly` | Essential only | Covers the most common 80% of use cases concisely. |
| `balancedCoverage` | Balanced coverage | Provides good depth with practical examples. |
| `comprehensive` | Comprehensive | Covers all features, edge cases, and advanced scenarios. |
| `aiDecide` | Let AI decide | The tool analyzes code complexity to suggest an appropriate depth. |

### Step 5: Select Primary Language

Choose the main language for your documentation. The system will detect your operating system's language and suggest it as the default.

**Prompt:** `üåê [5/10]: What's your main documentation language?`

You can select from a list of 12 supported languages, including English, Chinese (Simplified), and Spanish.

### Step 6: Choose Translation Languages

Select any additional languages into which you want the documentation to be translated.

**Prompt:** `üîÑ [6/10]: Which languages should we translate to?`

You can choose multiple languages from the supported options, excluding the primary language selected in the previous step.

### Step 7: Define Documentation Directory

Specify the folder where the generated documentation files will be saved.

**Prompt:** `üìÅ [7/10]: Where should we save your documentation?`

The default path is `.aigne/doc-smith/docs`. You can accept this default or provide a different path.

### Step 8: Specify Content Sources

Indicate which files and folders the tool should analyze to generate documentation. You can add multiple paths and use glob patterns for more specific file matching.

**Prompt:** `üîç [8/10]: Content Sources`

You will be prompted to enter file paths, folder paths, or glob patterns (e.g., `src/**/*.js`). If no paths are provided, the tool will analyze the entire project directory by default.

### Step 9: Provide Custom Rules

This optional step allows you to provide specific instructions or constraints for the AI to follow during content generation.

**Prompt:** `üìã [9/10]: Any custom rules or requirements for your documentation? (Optional, press Enter to skip)`

You can input any requirements, such as tone, style, or content to exclude. For example: "Focus on technical accuracy and avoid marketing terminology."

### Step 10: Configure Media Settings

Set a minimum width for images to be included in the documentation. This helps filter out low-resolution images or icons.

**Prompt:** `üñºÔ∏è [10/10]: Minimum image width (in pixels) to include in documentation:`

The default value is `800`. You can enter a different positive number to adjust the filter.

## The `config.yaml` File

After you answer all the questions, DocSmith saves your responses to a configuration file named `config.yaml`, located in the `.aigne/doc-smith/` directory of your project. This file acts as the blueprint for all future documentation generation and can be manually edited at any time.

Below is an example of a generated `config.yaml` file:

```yaml config.yaml icon=logos:yaml
