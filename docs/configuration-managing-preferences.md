# Managing Preferences

When you generate or update documentation, you can provide feedback using the `--feedback` flag. This feedback is saved as a "preference" to be reused in future sessions, ensuring the AI maintains consistency with your previous instructions. The `aigne doc prefs` command provides a direct way to manage these saved preferences.

This guide details how to list, remove, and toggle the active status of your saved preferences.

## Viewing Saved Preferences

To review all saved preferences, use the `--list` flag. This command displays each preference with its status, scope, unique ID, and content.

```bash
aigne doc prefs --list
```

### Understanding the Output

The list is formatted to provide clear information about each preference rule:

*   **Status**: Indicates if a preference is active or inactive.
    *   `ðŸŸ¢`: Active. The rule will be applied during documentation generation.
    *   `âšª`: Inactive. The rule is saved but will be ignored.
*   **Scope**: The context in which the preference applies (e.g., `global`, `document`).
*   **ID**: A unique identifier for the preference, used for removing or toggling.
*   **Paths**: If the preference applies only to specific files, their paths are listed here.
*   **Rule Content**: The text of the preference rule itself.

**Example Output:**

```
# User Preferences

**Format explanation:**
- ðŸŸ¢ = Active preference, âšª = Inactive preference
- [scope] = Preference scope (global, structure, document, translation)
- ID = Unique preference identifier
- Paths = Specific file paths (if applicable)

   Use a formal and academic tone throughout the documentation.

```

## Removing Preferences

When a preference is no longer needed, you can permanently delete it using the `--remove` flag. You can remove preferences either by specifying their IDs or through an interactive menu.

### Interactive Mode

To select preferences from a list, run the command without any IDs. This will open an interactive prompt where you can check the items you wish to delete.

```bash
aigne doc prefs --remove
```

A checklist will appear, allowing you to select one or more preferences. This is the recommended method for ensuring you remove the correct items.

### Direct Mode

If you already know the unique IDs of the preferences you want to remove, you can specify them using the `--id` flag. This is faster if you are certain about which items to delete.

```bash
# Remove a single preference
aigne doc prefs --remove --id 2af5c

# Remove multiple preferences
aigne doc prefs --remove --id 2af5c --id 8b1e2
```

## Toggling Preferences

Instead of permanently deleting a preference, you can temporarily enable or disable it. This is useful when you want to suspend a rule for a specific task without losing it. Use the `--toggle` flag to change a preference's active status.

### Interactive Mode

Running the command without IDs will launch an interactive checklist, similar to the remove command.

```bash
aigne doc prefs --toggle
```

You can select the preferences you wish to activate or deactivate. The status icon (`ðŸŸ¢`/`âšª`) will update to reflect the new state.

### Direct Mode

To toggle specific preferences directly, use the `--id` flag.

```bash
# Toggle a single preference
aigne doc prefs --toggle --id 2af5c

# Toggle multiple preferences
aigne doc prefs --toggle --id 2af5c --id 8b1e2
```

By managing your preferences, you can maintain fine-grained control over the documentation generation process, ensuring that the output consistently aligns with your project's specific requirements and style.
